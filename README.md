In the proposed SSFRM system, the lifecycle encompasses analysis, design, development, deployment, and testing of a mobile application tailored for efficient fertilizer distribution. The analysis phase identifies existing system issues and outlines the requirements for the proposed SSFRM. Design involves structuring the application, and a prototype is developed for visualization. During development, functionalities like coupon distribution, unique code generation, mobile payments, and SMS reminders are implemented, with concurrent testing ensuring usability and robustness. Once fully developed, the SSFRM system, facilitating farmer registration, coupon distribution, tracking, SMS communication, Stripe transactions, and report generation, undergoes deployment for practical use. This comprehensive approach aims to revolutionize fertilizer distribution for smallholder farmers.
